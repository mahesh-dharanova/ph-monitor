# AGENTS.md

Rules for any agent working in this repo (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode with a local model,
others). Work here may switch agents mid-task: everything needed to continue lives in this
repo, never in an agent's private memory. `CLAUDE.md` in this repo just points here.

ph-monitor is a single Arduino Uno R4 WiFi sensor node (PH-4502C pH module). Phase 1 scope:
filtered, health-checked, calibration-flagged pH readings over serial only — no networking,
logging, or dashboard. See `plan.md` for the full roadmap and `architecture.md` for why the
code is split the way it is.

## If you are a small model (1.5B to 3B, 16k context)
- One chunk per session. Read only `current_state.md` and the one module you're touching.
- Copy an existing module's pattern (e.g. a new pure-logic module: copy `filter.h`/`filter.cpp`
  and its test) instead of inventing a new shape.
- Unsure? Stop and say exactly what you do not understand. Never guess a fix.

## Where the truth lives
- Progress: `git log --oneline -15`, then `current_state.md`.
- Roadmap: `plan.md` (stable; only changes on a real scope decision).
- Design/module boundaries: `architecture.md` (stable; only changes on a real design decision).
- Hardware-in-loop results: `docs/TEST_LOG.md` (dated entries, never overwritten).
- Do not create HANDOFF or status files. Continuity is `current_state.md` + the commits.

## Documentation model (three tiers — see `~/Dev/CLAUDE.md`'s workspace conventions)

1. **This repo** — the engineering source of truth. `docs/TEST_LOG.md` gets a dated entry
   the same session as every hardware trial (readings, observations, pass/fail), whether or
   not it's the outcome hoped for. `current_state.md` updates in the same commit as every
   verified chunk. Nothing here waits for the project to finish.
2. **`mahesh-dharanova/publications`** (middle tier, informal) — Chunk 2's hardware session
   (sensor wired, five liquids tested) already produced real experimental data worth a
   write-up, so the tier-2 trigger has already been reached: draft it there under a new
   topic folder, in the three house styles (`templates/dharanova-strict`,
   `templates/academic-imrad`, `templates/dharanova-narrative`). See that repo's own
   `README.md`/`templates/README.md`. Treat every chunk from here on the same way — don't
   wait for a specific future chunk number.
3. **`dharanova-code/publications`** (official) — only the `dharanova-strict` draft moves
   here, only after Phase 1 is fully tested and demoed, per that repo's
   `PUBLISHING_GUIDELINES.md`. Never fabricate a number; every figure traces to a file in
   `data/` or is labelled calculated/simulated/datasheet.

## Module boundary (the one rule that matters most here)
`firmware/ph_monitor/ph_monitor.ino` is an orchestrator ONLY: `setup()`/`loop()` calling into
modules, no logic of its own. Every module is one concern:
- `sensor.*` — the only module allowed to touch `Arduino.h` / `analogRead()`.
- `filter.*`, `health.*`, `calibration.*`, `reporting.*` — plain C++, no `Arduino.h`, so they
  compile and run as real unit tests on the host with `g++` (`tests/run_tests.sh`).
- `health` (is the sensor behaving plausibly?) and `calibration` (do we trust the pH mapping?)
  are separate signals. Never merge them or infer one from the other — a sensor can be
  healthy but uncalibrated, or calibrated but currently out of range.

## Commands (repo root)
- Host unit tests (fast, no hardware): `tests/run_tests.sh`
- Compile for the board (no upload): `scripts/compile.sh`
- Upload (board connected): `scripts/upload.sh /dev/ttyACMx`
- Monitor: `arduino-cli monitor -p /dev/ttyACMx --config baudrate=115200`

## Chunk protocol
1. Say the goal and how you will verify it, in two lines.
2. Bug: write the failing test first. Feature: its test comes in the same chunk.
3. Smallest change that works, in the style of the surrounding code. No drive-by edits.
4. Verify: `tests/run_tests.sh` for pure modules; `scripts/compile.sh` always; hardware
   session + `docs/TEST_LOG.md` entry for anything touching `sensor.*` or the `.ino`.
5. Update `current_state.md` in the same commit: what's done, what's next.
6. Commit after every verified chunk (message = what changed, how verified, what's open).
   Pushing needs the user's explicit go-ahead the first time a remote exists.

## Never
- Secrets in files (not applicable yet — no networking in Phase 1, but keep it true when
  Phase 2 adds WiFi).
- Hardcoded machine values (paths, usernames). Pin numbers and board constants belong in
  `config.h` as named constants, not scattered literals.
- Claiming a calibrated reading without real buffer-solution data. Phase 1 output is always
  tagged `"calibrated":false` until Phase 2 supplies fitted calibration points from pH 4.01 /
  6.86 / 9.18 (or equivalent) reference buffers.
- Weakening or deleting a test to get green. If a host test fails, the module is wrong.
- `git push`, `reset`, `rebase`, force anything, without the user's explicit approval.

## Too big or risky for a small model: stop and say so
Any change to the calibration curve's shape (not just its constants), ADC resolution
assumptions, anything that would make `sensor.*` do more than read and convert, and anything
needing hardware you don't have physical access to verify.

## Hard-won facts
- Module is a PH-4502C: 6-pin header `PO, TO, DO, G, G, V+`. Phase 1 uses only `PO` (analog
  pH signal) and power/ground — `TO` (onboard thermistor, for temperature compensation) and
  `DO` (digital threshold comparator) are unused; see `architecture.md` for why.
- No pH buffer reference solutions on hand at project start — Phase 1 ships an explicit
  `UNCALIBRATED` curve (vendor-typical neutral-voltage/slope constants), same pattern as the
  sibling `turbidity-monitor` project. Real calibration is a Phase 2 task once buffers exist.
